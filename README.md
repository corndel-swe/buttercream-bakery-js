This project aims to provide the business owners of Buttercream Bakery Ltd with
a suite of utilities for managing their business. The business owners have
expressed an interest in help with inventory management, financial reporting and
analytics.

The client hasn't given us a comprehensive list of requirements. We're working
with them in an agile way, and they are happy to hear suggestions for additional
features which will help them with their overall goal to manage their business
more efficiently and spend more time thinking about cupcakes.
